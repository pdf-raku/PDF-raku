  tweak write-real method to match Lib::PDF::Writer.write-real

Release 0.2.3

  -- Simplify method accessors. direct use of AT-KEY, ASSIGN-KEY,
     etc. 20% speed up of test suite run.
- [PDF::DAO::Util]
  -- convert enums to ints in to-ast()
  -- rename sub to-ast-native() -> ast-coerce()
- [PDF::Writer]
  -- use native functions from Lib::PDF::Writer, when available.

Release 0.2.2

- [PDF::IO::Handle] Open I/O as :bin 
- Experimental use of Lib::PDF
  -- Speed up the slowest test xt/filter-predictors_bulk.t
  -- Fast packing alternative for PDF::IO::Util
  Optional, and for regression purposes, at this stage. Probably
  wont persue seriously until Rakudo has better JIT.

Release 0.2.1
- Renamed classes PDF::IO to PDF::IO::Util and PDF::IO::Input::*
  to PDF::IO::*.
- Don't cache misses in PDF::DAO::Delegator
- PDF::IO::Filter::Predictors now handles /BitsPerComponent < 8
- Replace PDF::IO::Util resample() with pack(), unpack()

Release 0.2.0
- Renamed class PDF::DAO::Type::PDF to PDF. Restored module name
  to PDF

Release 0.1.1
- [PDF::Reader] now handles very large xref tables or streams (> 65K)
- [PDF::DAO] use 'but' to apply roles to simple scalars, not 'does'.

Release 0.1.0
Renamed class namespace PDF::Storage -> PDF::IO. Used as the module
name

Release 0.0.9
- class PDF::DAO::Stream is now based on PDF::DAO::Dict
- withdrew non-standard PDF::DAO::Dict.new( $dict) positionals,
  in favour of PDF::DAO::Dict.new( :$dict ) named arguments.
  Same also for stream and array object constructors.
- Use of siglless variables, where appropriate.
- Revamped handing of PDF::DAO::Tie :entry and :index traits.
- Fixes for PDF::Storage::Input::Str (byte-string reader) and
  PDF::Storage::Filter::Predictors

Release 0.0.8
- [PDF::DAO::Doc] .update( :diffs(...) ) - now supports JSON
- Renamed classes
  -- PDF::DAO::Doc -> PDF::DAO::Type::PDF
  -- PDF::DAO::Storage::Crypt::Doc -> PDF::DAO::Storage::Crypt::PDF
- [PDF::DAO::Type::XRef] renamed methods
  -- decode-to-stage2 -> decode-index
  -- encode-from-stage2 -> encode-index
- [PDF::Writer]
  -- refactored 'write' multi method into node-specific methods
     (write-array, write-bool, ... etc)
  -- handle comments in write-op method
- [PDF::Writer] [PDF::Storage::Filter::RunLength] fixed handling
  of DOS newline graphemes "\r\n"
- [bin/pdf-rewriter.pl] fixed --rebuild option

Release 0.0.7
- [PDF::Storage::Crypt] Encryption refactored to use OpenSSL. Added support for
  PDF 1.6+ AES-128 encryption.
- [PDF::DAO::Doc] add saves-as( :update ) option.
  The input PDF is copied to the destination PDF, which is then incrementally
  updated. This should generally be faster than a regular .save-as.
- [PDF::Reader] Bug fixes to JSON serialization
- [PDF::Storage::Filter] simplified filter dispatch

Release 0.0.6
- [bin/pdf-rewriter.pl] unbust rewriting/recompression of encrypted PDFs
- [PDF::Storage::Serializer][PDF::DAO::{Array|Dict|Stream}] use Perl 6 object hashes
  -- Refactored `my %h; ...; %hash{$object.WHICH}` with `my %h{Any}; ...; %hash{$object}` 
     (See http://doc.perl6.org/type/Hash#Object_hashes_and_type_constraints)

- [PDF::DAO::Doc]
  -- added $doc.ast method. factored out from $doc.save-as
  -- Added $doc.Str method; for in-memory serialization
  -- $doc.save-as($target); # can now be file-name, io-path, or io-handle
  -- added $.update( :diffs(...) ) option.
  This allows the update body to be saved to a separate 'differences' file, as an
  alternative to appending to the original PDF.

  Useful in a mail-merge scenario where multiple documents are being produced
  from a common template and each can be reconstituted by appending the
  update file to the original template.

  Possible further work:
  -- JSON output of 'to' files
  -- add `$doc.open( $file, :diff(...))` option - load a base pdf, then apply
     differences.
- [PDF::Reader] bug-fixes:
  -- avoid encrypting the encryption dictionary
  -- fixed de-Linearization. Now handled by PDF::Storage::Serializer
- [PDF::Storage::Filter] bug fixes:
  -- fixed ascii-85, ascii-hex and run-length encoders to add
     end-of-data markers
  -- withdrew LZW encoding

Release 0.0.5
- added some reader exception classes, e.g. X::PDF::BadXRef
- renamed META.info => META6.json
- changed $.delegator.find-delegate method
- removed PDF::DAO::Type
- [PDF::DAO::Delegator]
  -- simplified and more general coercement to roles
  -- added X::PDF::Coerce warning
- [PDF::DAO::Tie]
  -- removed support for method aliases
- [PDF::Storage::Filter::Predictors]
  -- fixed multi-channel (color) PNG prediction

Release 0.0.4
- encrypted document creation is now supported. RC4 (Encryption revisions 1-4)
  only at this stage. 
- [PDF::Writer]
  -- add extra new-line after each indirect object - readability improvement

Release 0.0.3
- [PDF::DAO::Util] from-ast() sub now handles cyclical hashes and arrays

Release 0.0.2
- [META.info] Correct PDF::Storage::Filter::Predictors entry
- [PDF::Writer]
  -- improved formatting of PDF output. Reduced number of new-lines in output.
     --- '>> stream' are now cuddled together on a line
     --- as are 'endstream endobj'
  -- added $.make-body and $.make-xref methods

Release 0.0.1
- Initial release
