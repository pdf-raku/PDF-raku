Release 0.0.6
- [bin/pdf-rewriter.pl] unbust rewriting/recompression of encrypted PDFs

  -- Refactored `my %h; ...; %hash{$object.WHICH}` with `my %h{Any}; ...; %hash{$object}` 
     (See http://doc.perl6.org/type/Hash#Object_hashes_and_type_constraints)

- [PDF::DAO::Doc]
  -- added $doc.ast method. factored out from $doc.save-as
  -- Added $doc.Str method; for in-memory serialization
  -- $doc.save-as($target); # can now be file-name, io-path, or io-handle

  This allows the update body to be saved to a separate 'differences' file, as an
  alternative to appending to the original PDF.

  Useful in a mail-merge scenario where multiple documents are being produced
  from a common template and each can be reconstituted by appending the
  update file to the original template.

  Possible further work:
  -- JSON output of 'to' files
  -- add `$doc.open( $file, :diff(...))` option - load a base pdf, then apply
     differences.
